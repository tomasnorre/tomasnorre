### Hi there 👋

#### I'm excited to share a new chapter in my life — I have started working as a freelancer!

My focus areas include TYPO3, general PHP development, DevOps, and automation. If you're looking for support in any of these areas — or something related — feel free to reach out. I still have openings in my schedule.

I speak in English, German, and Danish.

You can learn more about my services at https://7th-green.com.

Even if you don’t need my help right now, I’d truly appreciate it if you’d help spread the word. Thank you in advance!
