### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

**I'm excited to share a new chapter in my life â€” I have started working as a freelancer!**

My focus areas include TYPO3, general PHP development, DevOps, and automation. If you're looking for support in any of these areas â€” or something related â€” feel free to reach out. I still have openings in my schedule.

I speak in English, German, and Danish.

You can learn more about my services at https://7th-green.com.

Even if you donâ€™t need my help right now, Iâ€™d truly appreciate it if youâ€™d help spread the word. Thank you in advance!
